<b>Introduction</b>

Developed by researcher at Kennesaw State University, OHPL directly addresses the unique requirements of the ordinal classification by using a point specific large margin loss function to group classes, while directly adhering to the ordinal information that are represented in the data. DNNâ€™s built using OHPL perform on par with existing high performing ordinal classifiers on small datasets, while demonstrating vastly improved results on larger standard benchmark large datasets.
